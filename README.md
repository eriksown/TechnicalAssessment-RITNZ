Technical Test by RecruitIT for Automation Tester role

Technical Test:

 

Please write a simple RESTful Web Service (Or if you are up for the challenge do this using GraphQL rather than as a RESTful service) that given two numbers will add them together and respond with the result.

Rules:
1.         The RESTful (or GraphQL) Web Service must be written in either Java or Javascript

2.         Please use GitHub to store your code and submit a link to your GitHub repository for us to review

3.         You do NOT need to write a client for this service

4.         You must develop it using BDD and TDD i.e. you must write both acceptance tests and unit tests (PRIOR to writing the code)

5.         Optionally: create a mock for your RESTful (or GraphQL) Web Service to write your automated tests against prior to writing the solution

6.         Remember that this is an Automation Tester role so the automated tests will be looked at closely
